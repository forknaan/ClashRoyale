Project Proposal

Description: CMU Royale

A PvE/PvP battle game centered around strategy. Each player will have a deck and be allowed to play cards to defeat the opponent's towers and get crowned victory.

Competitive Analysis: This game is inspired and mainly based off a similar successful game called Clash Royale which is a mobile game. I plan to inherit the original games mechanics, however there will be some smaller design changes to allow for more efficient code in CMU-graphics.

Structural Plan: I have broken my project into multiple files, the main file, the home file, the arena file. For the cards I am using a classes to represent them with their attributes and also to allow multiple instances of that class on the map at one time.

Algorithmic Plan: Currently I am not fully sure of the most complex parts of the program, however from what I can think of them. One will be the detecting of nearby enemies, going to the closest enemy and then fighting and resuming to the tower. Another one would be the AI that the player will play against. There is also the issue of choosing the closest tower to go to and what the path will be, ensuring that it is smooth and accurate.

Timeline Plan: I aim to have reached MVP by 26th November.

Version Control Plan: I am employing the use of GitHub for backup.

Module List: I only plan on using CMU-graphics until my MVP, possibly employ the use of Socket after MVP.
