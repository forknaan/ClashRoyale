# CMU Royale (A smaller simpler replica of Clash Royale)

A PvE battle game centered around strategy. Each player will have a deck and be allowed to play cards to defeat the opponent's towers and get crowned victory.


## Installation
 - You need to have CMU-Graphics library downloadedalong with python3, this can be done via a pip command:

  `pip install cmu_graphics`

 - There is an extra font that requires downloading, the ttf file is uploaded
   along with the rest of the files, ENSURE IT IS INSTALLED AS **"Supercell-Magic"**

## Playing the game

 - The program should run in any IDE or through terminal by running the 'main.py' file.
 
 - CMU-Graphics is kind of weird and it won't let me control the volume of Sounds so I recommend lowering your volume before running.

 - For the processor it is running on, I reccomend having a computer with a good dicrete graphics card and CPU, for optimum smooth gameplay.

 - There is one special key 'r' which can be used to run onAppStart simply, however if music is playing already, it won't stop (purely for debugging purposes).

  
## Final Comments

 - You are more than welcome to add your own features (I have some examples in the 'future plans.txt' file).

 - This code can be modified and used for personal projects, fully open-source

 - Also credits to Supercell and the Clash Royale team for making this amaizng game that I tried to replicate
